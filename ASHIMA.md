*embedded-STM23F-lib* is an open source core library for the STM32F series of
ARM microcontrolers from ST. The repo contains all the document analysis tools
to generate much of the lowest layer of the library with clear traceablity to
the datasheets. The higher layers of the library use C++ forms to ease
programming.
