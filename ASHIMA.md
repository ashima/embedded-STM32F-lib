*embedded-STM23F-lib v0.1* is a nascent open source core library for the STM32F 
series of ARM microcontrolers from ST. The repo contains all the document 
analysis tools to generate much of the lowest layer of the library with 
clear traceablity to the datasheets. The higher layers of the library use 
C++ patterns to ease programming.
