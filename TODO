This Library is a work in progress!! There is much to do, and much that
might change!

LIBRARY:
 * The lib has always had the potential to grow to more devices. I need
   to get the part numbers into some of the filenames correctly, and
   into the types of the classes. Inheritable Typelists FTW. (for example
   the cortex M4 registers cover STM32F3* and STM32F4*, the USART device, and
   TIM devices seem to be universal across STM32F* and DM00031020 covers only
   STM32F4[0-3]*.
 * strip defined symbols out of sections.ld and make a header for them.
 * generate mem.ld from infobase.xml
 * update and reinstate the unit tests for headers that are not likely
   to change much any more.
 * None of the classes really use proper patterns. Really ought to
   have a small object allocator, rather than avoiding the problem and 
   really ought to actulay make singletons singletons for example, 
   rather than just being static access to registers. For now the extra
   'safty' isn't that helpful, but still.

 * Maybe: breakout instance.h into seperate bits.
 * Maybe: subregisters are each a unique type, maybe they should derive
          from a base type with virtual access functions. Maybe function
          object wrappers are sufficient.
