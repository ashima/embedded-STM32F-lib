This Library is a work in progress!! There is much to do, and much that
might change!

LIBRARY:
 * include file guards should auto generate.
 * strip defined symbols out of sections.ld and make a header for them.
 * generate mem.ld from infobase.xml
 * update and reinstate the unit tests for headers that are not likely
   to change much any more.

 * Maybe: breakout instance.h into seperate bits.
 * Maybe: subregisters are each a unique type, maybe they should derive
          from a base type with virtual access functions. Maybe function
          object wrappers are sufficient.

DOC edits:
 * typo: the GPIO table p204,DM00031020 has OSPEEDER, it should be OSPEEDR
