This directory contains all the documents and utilites used to generate the
raw information base used to build the rest of the libray.

The goal is to provide clear tracability of information encoded in the library
to the documentation.

To make, type 'make'. To rebuild 'irritating', 'rm irritating/the_one_you_want_to_rebuild; make' (deliberately not automated in the makefile)

Files:

- generated:

-- infobase.xml: the documentation in machine-processible form

Directories:

- existing:

-- doc: hardware documentation to be read
-- byhand: hand-edited source material from the documents (e.g. errata, guidelines, etc.)
-- irritating: intermediary files that are stored in the repo because they're are irritating to rebuild (e.g. require specific apps to build)
-- scripts: the scripts!

- generated:

-- intermediates: all the pieces auto-built along the way
